# What's in this?

The portfolio is going to have all sorts of things! I'll post about anything I find interesting...

I'll post pics of me, my favorite video games, my work, books or music ... But i'll keep it fairly simple. That's just me...I'm a simple person...being simple feels elegant. I've always loved to create blogs, although I never found myself thoroughly maintaining it for some reason.
